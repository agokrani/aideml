- The code should **implement the proposed solution** and **print the value of the evaluation metric**.
- **Save all final output files to the ./submission/ directory as specified in the task description.**
- The code should be a single-file python program that is self-contained and can be executed as-is.
- No parts of the code should be skipped, don't terminate the before finishing the script.
- Your response should only contain a single code block.
- Be aware of the running time of the code, it should complete within {exec_timeout}.
- All the provided input data is stored in "./input" directory.
- The task description will specify what outputs are required.
- Ensure all required outputs are generated before the script completes.
