- <TOTAL_TIME_REMAINING: {time_remaining}>
- <TOTAL_STEPS_REMAINING: {steps_remaining}>
- The code should **implement the proposed solution**, **print the value of the evaluation metric computed on a hold-out validation set**,
- **AND MOST IMPORTANTLY SAVE PREDICTIONS ON THE PROVIDED UNLABELED TEST DATA IN A `submission.csv` FILE IN THE ./submission/ DIRECTORY.**
- The code should be a single-file python program that is self-contained and can be executed as-is.
- No parts of the code should be skipped, don't terminate the before finishing the script.
- Your response should only contain a single code block.
- Be aware of the running time of the code, it should complete within {exec_timeout}.
- All the provided input data is stored in "./input" directory.
- **You MUST submit predictions on the provided unlabeled test data in a `submission.csv` file** file in the "./working" directory as described in the task description** This is extremely important since this file is used for grading/evaluation. DO NOT FORGET THE submission.csv file!
- You can also use the "./working" directory to store any temporary files that your code needs to create.
- REMEMBER THE ./submission/submission.csv FILE!!!!! The correct directory is important too.
