Your response should be a detailed step-by-step plan that outlines:
1. What specific bug or issue you identified from the execution output
2. The root cause of the problem
3. The approach you will take to fix the issue
4. Any changes needed to the code structure or logic
5. How you will ensure the fix works and produces the required submission.csv

Keep the plan focused on debugging and fixing the specific issues identified.
