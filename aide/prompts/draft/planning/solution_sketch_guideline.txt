- This first solution design should be relatively simple, without ensembling or hyper-parameter optimization.
- Take the Memory section into consideration when proposing the design, don't propose the same modelling solution but keep the evaluation the same.
- The solution sketch should be 3-5 sentences.
- Propose an evaluation metric that is reasonable for this task.
- Don't suggest to do EDA.
- The data is already prepared and available in the "./input" directory. There is no need to unzip any files.

Your response should be a detailed step-by-step plan that outlines:
1. The approach you will take to solve this problem
2. The libraries and frameworks you will use
3. The data processing steps required
4. The model architecture or algorithm choice
5. The evaluation strategy
6. Any specific implementation considerations

Keep the plan concise but detailed enough for a developer to implement.
