- The solution sketch should be a brief natural language description of how the previous solution can be improved.
- You should be very specific and should only propose a single actionable improvement.
- This improvement should be atomic so that we can experimentally evaluate the effect of the proposed change.
- Take the Memory section into consideration when proposing the improvement.
- The solution sketch should be 3-5 sentences.
- Don't suggest to do EDA.

Your response should be a detailed step-by-step plan that outlines:
1. What specific aspect of the previous solution you will improve
2. Why this improvement will lead to better performance
3. The technical approach for implementing this improvement
4. Any new libraries or techniques you will use
5. How you will validate that the improvement works

Keep the plan focused on a single, atomic improvement.
